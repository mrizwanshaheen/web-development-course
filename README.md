# My Web Development Learning Journey  

Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Rizwan and this repo is where I keep all my daily practice files while learning my web development from the very basics.  

# Why Iâ€™m Doing This  

- To build a daily coding habit  
- To remember web development concepts better by writing them myself  
- To track my progress step by step  
- To share my journey with others.  

# How To Check My Files  

- Each day has a file like `day1.html`, `day2.html`, etc.  
- Just open them in a browser to see what I practiced on that day.  

Thanks for visiting my repo!  
Iâ€™ll keep learning and updating.
